This blog is a continuation of labs.viricmind.org, my first tech blog. I've lost
the domain many months ago, so I can't continue it using the same name. Luckily
most of it is accessible through archive.org:

* [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://labs.viricmind.org](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://labs.viricmind.org)

My previous blog was written in Spanish, but this time I'll continue writting in
English. Sometimes I'll consider to translate my posts to Spanish, but the
English version will always be present.

I have to improve this blog a lot, but it will take some time. I've thought on the following points:

* Adding links to my onlie profiles (Twitter, LinkedIN, Github, Stackoverflow,
  Kaggle, etc.)
* Changing the code syntax highlighting. The Sculpin.io default color scheme
  for code highlighting makes me cry.
* Adding a comments system. I know it's pretty straightforward to use **Disqus**,
  but I'm not fully convinced because privacy reasons. I've been reading many
  weeks ago about he possibility of integrating **Discourse** as a comments
  system inside static blogs. We'll see...
* Adding "in-house" analytics, maybe using something like **Piwik**.
* Finding (or programming) a "better" blog theme.
