PHP does not offer any native class to implement timestamps with milliseconds or
microseconds precision, the only "native" way to do it is working with the weird
microtime function and/or the `\MongoDate` class (available through the `mongo`
extension).

Using the `\DateTime` class is not enough, because it only can offer seconds
precision, and using the `\MongoDate` class isn't a good idea if you aren't
using MongoDB or if you care about coupling. In fact, the `mongo` extension will
be deprecated in a few months in favour of a new extension that is in active
development right now.

Because this, I've developed two Composer packages to allow using type hinting
without increasing coupling and with less abstraction leaks:

* PHP-Jiffy, a library that provides a timestamp class with milliseconds (and
  even microseconds) precision: [https://github.com/Litipk/php-jiffy/](https://github.com/Litipk/php-jiffy/).
* Doctrine MongoDB Jiffy, an addapter to use the PHP-Jiffy library with Doctrine's
  MongoDB ODM: [https://github.com/Litipk/doctrine-mongodb-jiffy](https://github.com/Litipk/doctrine-mongodb-jiffy).

Is my intention to modify the PHP-Jiffy library at the same time of the new
MongoDB's extension release, so it will be very useful for people who likes
moving fast to new software versions.
