Since today is possible to post comments in this blog :) . I've integrated the
[Isso](http://posativ.org/isso/) commenting system in order to allow readers to
send comments.

### My reasons

I've chosen this software because I don't want to help big companies to destroy
our privacy. If people want to tell to the world everything about themselves
then I'm not opposed to that, but I don't want to force the people who are
worried about protecting its privacy.

Disqus is a great option to add comments in static blogs, but it requires
registration and allows user tracking around the web.

### About the underlying technology

Isso is programmed in Python and runs in the server as a daemon, and it can be
integrated with the following "http handlers": **Gevent** (this isn't an http
handling library, but a generic non-blocking IO handling library), **uWSGI**,
**Gunicorn**, **mod_wsgi** (for Apache), and **mod_fastcgi** (also for Apache).

For simplicity, I've chosen to use **Gevent**, it's the easiest option (no
settings :D), but maybe I'll change the settings in the future in favour of
uWSGI because its flexibility.

**Gunicorn** is not an option because I need to optimize every service in my
server (my server is VERY tiny), and the prefork model isn't enough efficient.

**mod_wsgi**, and **mod_fastcgi** require some configuration and are too coupled
with the Apache server, so I won't consider them neither.

### Some points that I dislike

I'm very grateful for the existence of Isso, but I it needs some rework: The
management system is too complicated and rigid, there is lack of documentation,
and there aren't new releases since 7 months ago (I think this is because there
is a work in progress on a big refactor).

Because this, I'm considering to study the Isso's code in order to be able to
contribute, or to fork the project if my needs don't match with the project's
aims.
